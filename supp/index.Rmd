# Preface {-}

>If you describe something with great accuracy, you describe it as closely as you can to what it is, to its true value. If you describe something with great precision, you do so in the greatest possible detail, even though that detail may not necessarily be the true value of the thing being described. **Simon Winchester, _The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World_**

Generally considered diagnostic of Late Prehistoric Toyah assemblages, Perdiz arrow points are characteristic of the transition from the Late Prehistoric to the Protohistoric. If larger Perdiz arrow points from Caddo burials are conceived of as products of trade and/or exchange with Toyah groups, then those with longer blade lengths provide inference to shifts in Caddo selective preference, while those with shorter blade lengths evince local approaches to resharpening and/or retouch that were uniquely Caddo. This study asks whether linear shape variables convey discrete regional resharpening strategies, whether morphological trajectories differ between the northern and southern behavioural regions, and whether morphological disparity differs between larger and smaller size classes, as defined by differences in blade length. Results demonstrate distinct regional resharpening strategies and divergent morphological trajectories for Perdiz arrow points included as Caddo mortuary offerings in the northern and southern behavioural regions. Perdiz arrow point shapes were not found to differ in the large size class between the northern and southern behavioural regions, demonstrating consistency in Caddo preference, or—alternatively—Toyah manufacture. However, differences in the small size class suggest discrete local approaches to resharpening and/or retouch by Caddo knappers. Caddo groups that occupied the southern behavioural region may have also been less selective, preferring Perdiz arrow points with a greater range of diversity in shape and size, while their counterparts to the north preferred a more standardized product.

## Primary findings

```{r MAP, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Location of sites with Perdiz arrow points included in the study, extent of major drainage basins (Neches [brown], Sabine [maroon], and Red [navy] Rivers), and extent of the ancestral Caddo region (white). In the context of this effort, those sites from the Red River basin (navy) constitute the `northern behavioural region`, while those from the Sabine (maroon) and Neches (brown) River basins represent the `southern behavioural region`."}

### Linear metrics

For this effort, the mean `maximum blade length` for Perdiz arrow points from each behavioural region was calculated and used to bin the sample into two groups (henceforth, `size classes`); one with a longer blade, and the other, shorter. Following the assignment of `size classes`, data were joined in advance of analysis. 

The morphological form (shape + size) of the Perdiz arrow points was then split into `shape` (representing proportions between dimensions in an object) and `size` (sensu Klingenberg [-@RN11105]). `Size` and `shape` were calculated using the method of log-shape ratios proposed by Mosimann [-@RN11104], where the `geometric mean` is considered a proxy for size, and shape was calculated as the log of isometric size subtracted from the log of each linear/dimensional measure.

An ANOVA was subsequently used to assess `shape` as a function of `size class`.

#### Results

  - Blade length **differs significantly** between large and small Perdiz arrow point `size classes` in the northern and southern behavioural regions
  - Shoulder width **differs significantly** between large and small Perdiz arrow point `size classes` in the southern behavioural region, but **does not differ** in the northern behavioural region
  - Width **differs significantly** between large and small Perdiz arrow point `size classes` in the southern behavioural region, but **does not differ** in the northern behavioural region
  - Thickness **does not differ** between large and small Perdiz arrow point `size classes` from either behavioural region
  - Stem length **does not differ** between large and small Perdiz arrow point `size classes` from either behavioural region
  - Stem width **does not differ** between large and small Perdiz arrow point `size classes` from either behavioural region

In both cases, attributes associated with hafting---`maximum stem length` and `stem width`---are morphologically stable. However, differential approaches to resharpening and/or retouch resulted in distinct shape differences in Perdiz arrow point blades. Resharpening and/or retouch efforts of Caddo knappers from the northern behavioural region was limited to `maximum blade length`, while those from the southern behavioural region were found to be more dynamic, including changes in `maximum blade length`, `width`, and `shoulder width` that occur between `size classes`."}

### Geometric morphometrics

This analysis follows recent geometric morphometric analyses of Perdiz arrow points ([Selden and Dockall, in review](https://github.com/seldenlab/perdiz3/blob/main/ms/perdiz3/perdiz3.pdf)) and Gahagan biface morphology across the southern Caddo area and central Texas [@RN11783;@RN21001], where Perdiz arrow points and Gahagan bifaces have been found to differ in shape across the same geography as Caddo bottles [@RN11801;@RN11782;@RN11716;@RN8312].

It also follows a recent geometric morphometric analysis in which Perdiz arrow points from the ancestral Caddo area were found to differ as a function of time, raw material, and burial context [@RN9551;@RN8980].

Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system [@RN11622;@RN11623;@RN11563], achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition [@RN478] performed in R 4.1.3 [@R] using the `geomorph` library v. 4.0.3 [@RN11530;@RN1774;@RN9565]. Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects [@RN11564;@RN478]. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space [@RN1646;@RN11563]. 

Principal components analysis [@RN1746] was used to visualise shape variation among the Perdiz arrow points. The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference 3D mesh [@RN1731;@RN479].

```

To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry) or differs by size class, Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1749] were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions [@RN8446]. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1655;@RN11775], which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present [@RN1719]. These results are detailed in Chapter 2.

```

A phenotypic trajectory analysis [@RN8344;@RN8550;@RN8569;@RN8533;@RN8446] was used to assess whether Caddo reduction or retouch trajectories differ between the northern and southern behavioural regions. The trajectory analysis was followed by an analysis of morphological disparity [@RN11107;@RN7041;@RN5694] to identify potential differences in morphological diversity between size classes.

```{r trajectory, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Visualization of two shape trajectories for Perdiz arrow points (large/small) that occur in the northern and southern behavioural regions. Shape trajectories are projected onto the first two principal components of between-group shape variation (based on covariance matrix of group means). Trajectories are shown as lines, where the northern behavioural region is represented by squares, and the southern behavioural region by triangles. Transformations are added to facilitate an understanding of shape differences corresponding to large and small Perdiz arrow point shapes from each behavioural region."}

Images and additional information for all Perdiz arrow points used in this study can be viewed and downloaded from the digital comparative collection [https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-perdiz/](https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-perdiz/). The replicable nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN21001], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
