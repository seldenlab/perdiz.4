Selden, Jr.1 2022-04-18 Preface If you describe something with great accuracy, you describe it as closely as you can to what it is, to its true value. If you describe something with great precision, you do so in the greatest possible detail, even though that detail may not necessarily be the true value of the thing being described. Simon Winchester, The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World Generally considered diagnostic of Late Prehistoric Toyah assemblages, Perdiz arrow points are characteristic of the transition from the Late Prehistoric to the Protohistoric. If larger Perdiz arrow points from Caddo burials are conceived of as products of trade and/or exchange with Toyah groups, then those with longer blade lengths provide inference to shifts in Caddo selective preference, while those with shorter blade lengths evince local approaches to resharpening and/or retouch that were uniquely Caddo. This study asks whether linear shape variables convey discrete regional resharpening strategies, whether morphological trajectories differ between the northern and southern behavioural regions, and whether morphological disparity differs between larger and smaller size classes, as defined by differences in blade length. Results demonstrate distinct regional resharpening strategies and divergent morphological trajectories for Perdiz arrow points included as Caddo mortuary offerings in the northern and southern behavioural regions. Perdiz arrow point shapes were not found to differ in the large size class between the northern and southern behavioural regions, demonstrating consistency in Caddo preference, oralternativelyToyah manufacture. However, differences in the small size class suggest discrete local approaches to resharpening and/or retouch by Caddo knappers. Caddo groups that occupied the southern behavioural region may have also been less selective, preferring Perdiz arrow points with a greater range of diversity in shape and size, while their counterparts to the north preferred a more standardized product. Figure 0.1: Visualization of expectations 1) for Perdiz arrow point trajectories, where (a) morphological disparity in shape (dashed lines) is greater at a larger size (selective preference), and/or (b) morphological disparity in shape is greater at a smaller size (resharpening and/or retouch); where 2) morphological disparity in Perdiz arrow points is expected to be greater where blade length is shorter, due to episodic reduction or retouch; and 3) illustration of Perdiz arrow points offerings included with Caddo burials. 0.1 Primary findings Figure 0.2: Location of sites with Perdiz arrow points included in the study, extent of major drainage basins (Neches [brown], Sabine [maroon], and Red [navy] Rivers), and extent of the ancestral Caddo region (white). In the context of this effort, those sites from the Red River basin (navy) constitute the northern behavioural region, while those from the Sabine (maroon) and Neches (brown) River basins represent the southern behavioural region. 0.1.1 Linear metrics For this effort, the mean maximum blade length for Perdiz arrow points from each behavioural region was calculated and used to bin the sample into two groups (henceforth, size classes); one with a longer blade, and the other, shorter. Following the assignment of size classes, data were joined in advance of analysis. The morphological form (shape + size) of the Perdiz arrow points was then split into shape (representing proportions between dimensions in an object) and size (sensu Klingenberg (2016)). Size and shape were calculated using the method of log-shape ratios proposed by Mosimann (1970), where the geometric mean is considered a proxy for size, and shape was calculated as the log of isometric size subtracted from the log of each linear/dimensional measure. An ANOVA was subsequently used to assess shape as a function of size class. ## boxplots by size class knitr::include_graphics(&#39;img/boxplot-linear.png&#39;) Figure 0.3: Boxplot by size class. ## pca by size class knitr::include_graphics(&#39;img/pca-linear.png&#39;) Figure 0.4: PCA by size class. 0.1.1.1 Results Blade length differs significantly between large and small Perdiz arrow point size classes in the northern and southern behavioural regions Shoulder width differs significantly between large and small Perdiz arrow point size classes in the southern behavioural region, but does not differ in the northern behavioural region Width differs significantly between large and small Perdiz arrow point size classes in the southern behavioural region, but does not differ in the northern behavioural region Thickness does not differ between large and small Perdiz arrow point size classes from either behavioural region Stem length does not differ between large and small Perdiz arrow point size classes from either behavioural region Stem width does not differ between large and small Perdiz arrow point size classes from either behavioural region ## resharpening knitr::include_graphics(&#39;img/img2/linresharp.png&#39;) Figure 0.5: Conceptual rendering of differences found to occur between Perdiz arrow point resharpening trajectories in the a, northern; and b, southern behavioural regions. In both cases, attributes associated with haftingmaximum stem length and stem widthare morphologically stable. However, differential approaches to resharpening and/or retouch resulted in distinct shape differences in Perdiz arrow point blades. Resharpening and/or retouch efforts of Caddo knappers from the northern behavioural region was limited to maximum blade length, while those from the southern behavioural region were found to be more dynamic, including changes in maximum blade length, width, and shoulder width that occur between size classes. 0.1.2 Geometric morphometrics This analysis follows recent geometric morphometric analyses of Perdiz arrow points (Selden and Dockall, in review) and Gahagan biface morphology across the southern Caddo area and central Texas (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), where Perdiz arrow points and Gahagan bifaces have been found to differ in shape across the same geography as Caddo bottles (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021). It also follows a recent geometric morphometric analysis in which Perdiz arrow points from the ancestral Caddo area were found to differ as a function of time, raw material, and burial context (Selden Jr et al. 2021; Selden Jr. et al. 2021). Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.1.3 (R Core Development Team, 2022) using the geomorph library v. 4.0.3 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). Principal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualise shape variation among the Perdiz arrow points. The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference 3D mesh (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014). ## pca knitr::include_graphics(&#39;img/img2/gm-pca.png&#39;) Figure 0.6: PCA by size class, illustrating variability associated with basal morphology in PC1, and variability associated with blade morphology in PC2. To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry) or differs by size class, Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Michael. L. Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; M. L. Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). These results are detailed in Chapter 2. ## allometric (shape + size) trajectories by size class knitr::include_graphics(&#39;img/allometric.traj.png&#39;) Figure 0.7: The homogeneity of slopes test indicates that the slopes associated with large and small Perdiz arrow points from the northern and southern behavioural regions differ. This figure plots the first principal component of predicted values versus size as a stylized graphic of the allometric trend. A phenotypic trajectory analysis (Adams and Collyer 2007, 2009; M. L. Collyer and Adams 2007, 2013; Michael. L. Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015) was used to assess whether Caddo reduction or retouch trajectories differ between the northern and southern behavioural regions. The trajectory analysis was followed by an analysis of morphological disparity (M. L. Collyer and Adams 2020; Foote 1993; Zelditch et al. 2004) to identify potential differences in morphological diversity between size classes. ## Perdiz arrow point shape trajectories by size class knitr::include_graphics(&#39;img/img2/trajectory.png&#39;) Figure 0.8: Visualization of two shape trajectories for Perdiz arrow points (large/small) that occur in the northern and southern behavioural regions. Shape trajectories are projected onto the first two principal components of between-group shape variation (based on covariance matrix of group means). Trajectories are shown as lines, where the northern behavioural region is represented by squares, and the southern behavioural region by triangles. Transformations are added to facilitate an understanding of shape differences corresponding to large and small Perdiz arrow point shapes from each behavioural region. 0.1.2.1 Results Perdiz arrow point shape differs significantly between the large and small size classes in the northern behavioural region Perdiz arrow point shape differs significantly in the small size class between the northern and southern behavioural regions Perdiz arrow point size differs significantly in the large size class between the northern and southern behavioural regions Perdiz arrow point size differs significantly in the small size class between the northern and southern behavioural regions Allometry is significant, and the homogeneity of slopes test indicates that the slopes associated with large and small Perdiz arrow points from the northern and southern behavioural regions differ Modularity is significant Morphological integration is significant Results of the trajectory analysis demonstrate a significant difference between shape trajectories in the northern and southern behavioural regions Results of the morphological disparity analysis by shape demonstrate that the large Perdiz arrow points from the southern behavioural region occupy a significantly greater range of morphospace than the large and small Perdiz arrow points from the northern behavioural region Results of the morphological disparity analysis by size demonstrate that the large Perdiz arrow points from the southern behavioural region occupy a significantly greater range of morphospace than the large Perdiz arrow points in the northern behavioural region 0.2 Acknowledgments I extend my gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Caddo Nation Tribal Council, Tribal Chairman, and Tribal Historic Preservation Office for their guidance related to the development of the scanning protocols, for permission and access to NAGPRA and previously repatriated collections, and for frank discussions related to language surrounding burial contexts associated with Caddo children.

Austin State University. 0.4 Data management The data and analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document or the GitHub repository, and is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/85BU7). Images and additional information for all Perdiz arrow points used in this study can be viewed and downloaded from the digital comparative collection https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-perdiz/. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovaite et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018). 0.5 Colophon This version of the analysis was generated on 2022-04-18 15:12:21 using the following computational environment and dependencies: # what R packages and versions were used? if (&quot;devtools&quot; %in% installed.packages()) devtools::session_info() ## - Session info --------------------------------------------------------------- ## setting value ## version R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10) ## os Windows 10 x64 (build 19044) ## system x86_64, mingw32 ## ui RTerm ## language (EN) ## collate English_United States.1252 ## ctype English_United States.1252 ## tz America/Chicago ## date 2022-04-18 ## pandoc 2.14.0.3 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/bin/pandoc/ (via rmarkdown) ## ## - Packages ------------------------------------------------------------------- ## package * version date (UTC) lib source ## bookdown 0.26 2022-04-15 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## brio 1.1.3 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## bslib 0.3.1 2021-10-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## cachem 1.0.6 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## callr 3.7.0 2021-04-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## cli 3.2.0 2022-02-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## crayon 1.5.1 2022-03-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## desc 1.4.1 2022-03-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## devtools 2.4.3 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## digest 0.6.29 2021-12-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## ellipsis 0.3.2 2021-04-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## evaluate 0.15 2022-02-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## fastmap 1.1.0 2021-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## fs 1.5.2 2021-12-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## glue 1.6.2 2022-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## highr 0.9 2021-04-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## htmltools 0.5.2 2021-08-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## jquerylib 0.1.4 2021-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## jsonlite 1.8.0 2022-02-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## knitr 1.38 2022-03-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## lifecycle 1.0.1 2021-09-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## magrittr 2.0.3 2022-03-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## memoise 2.0.1 2021-11-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## pkgbuild 1.3.1 2021-12-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## pkgload 1.2.4 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## prettyunits 1.1.1 2020-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## processx 3.5.3 2022-03-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## ps 1.6.0 2021-02-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## purrr 0.3.4 2020-04-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## R6 2.5.1 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## remotes 2.4.2 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## rlang 1.0.2 2022-03-04 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## rmarkdown 2.13 2022-03-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## rprojroot 2.0.3 2022-04-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## rstudioapi 0.13 2020-11-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## sass 0.4.1 2022-03-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## sessioninfo 1.2.2 2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## stringi 1.7.6 2021-11-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## stringr 1.4.0 2019-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## testthat 3.1.3 2022-03-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## usethis 2.1.5 2021-12-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## withr 2.5.0 2022-03-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## xfun 0.30 2022-03-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3) ## yaml 2.3.5 2022-02-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## ## [1] C:/Users/seldenjrz/Documents/R/win-library/4.1 ## [2] C:/Program Files/R/R-4.1.3/library ## ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Git commit details are: # where can I find this commit? if (&quot;git2r&quot; %in% installed.packages() &amp; git2r::in_repository(path = &quot;.&quot;)) git2r::repository(here::here()) ## Local: main E:/github/perdiz.4 ## Remote: main @ origin (https://github.com/seldenlab/perdiz.4) ## Head: [ff03a44] 2022-04-18: &lt;edit ms&gt; References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
